2012.12.02 ACME Training One - The 2012 ACM-ICPC Asia Chengdu Regional Contest[team]
#TODO

This is my first cooperation with my new teammates, WDP and WHD. Our team is called ACME, which can be understood as AC me, or it original meaning the peak.

#A AC 8 mins 1 wrong try by WHD
#I AC 17 mins
It is a typical DP problem.
#B AC 76 mins 1 wrong try
It is a math problem. WDP told me the meaning of the problem, and I come up with a formula soon.
Let f(p) be p*sum{p^n*(1-p)^i*C(i,n+1)*(n-i);i=0 to n}.
The answer will f(p)+f(1-p).
However for some certain i, p^n*(1-p)^i*C(i,n+1)*(n-i) can be too small, to avoid underflow errors we can calculate ln(p^n*(1-p)^i*C(i,n+1)*(n-i)) instead.
When we use it, we use e^ln(p^n*(1-p)^i*C(i,n+1)*(n-i)) and if ln(p^n*(1-p)^i*C(i,n+1)*(n-i)) is too small we just ignore it.

We come up with a n^1.5*logn algorithm for problem C and got TLE. We also used the algorithm proved to be right to solve problem K, but didn't get AC. I think it must be some bugs when facing edge cases.

2012.12.05 ACME Training Three - Graph Theory Problems[individual]

URAL 1272 Non-Yekaterinburg Subway
Disjoint-set

URAL 1156 Two Rounds
Bipartite graph
Knapsack problem

URAL 1128 Partition into Groups
Bipartite graph
I got RE because I used a variable at a wrong place (it should be j, but I wrote i there) and wasted lots of time to debug it.

URAL 1400 Cellular Characters
BFS
I got WA because I used "\n" when output. When I changed it to "%n" I got AC.

URAL 1630 Talisman
It must be a straight line, a point, a triangle or a tetrahedron.

#B AC 31 mins 1 wrong try by WHD
#A AC 50 mins by WDP
#D AC 75 mins 3 wrong tries by WHD
#G AC 79 mins 5 wrong tries
It can be solved by brute force, but I used DP to solve it, so I wasted a lot of time.
#C AC 94 mins 1 wrong try
For a query, if b>sqrt(n), we can response it by brute force.
After do some preparations in O(n^1.5), we can response qeuries whose b<=sqrt(n) in O(1).
#F AC 118 mins 1 wrong try by WHD
#E AC 179 mins by WDP



2012.12.16 ACME Training Five - The 7th(2012) ACM Programming Contest of HUST - Onsite Contest(Semilive)[team,live]

link: http://acm.hust.edu.cn/contest.php?cid=1106

We started about 50 mins after the contest had begun.

#I AC 61 mins
Brute force
#E AC 105 mins
Greedy
#A AC 113 mins 2 wrong tries by WHD
#C AC 126 mins 1 wrong try
AC automation
#H AC 153 mins 1 wrong try
Math
#F AC 224 mins 1 wrong try
Game theory
#B AC 259 mins 5 wrong tries
The solution for this problem is first written by WHD. I rewrote it and got AC after 1 wrong try. 
#J AC 284 mins 4 wrong tries by WHD
WHD used a right algorithm to solve this problem, but made a small mistake. After I found it out, WHD corrected it and got AC.
